YESTEDAY

YESTERDAY, ALL MY TROUBLES SEEMS SO FARAWAY.
NOW IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THEY'RE HERE TO STAY,
OH, I BELIEVE IN YESTERDAY

SUDDENY, I'M NOT HALF THE MAN I USED TO BE
THERE'S A SHADOW HANGING OVER ME.
OH, YESTERDAY CAME SUDDENY

WHY SHE HAD TO GO I DON'T KNOW SHOW WOULD'N SAY
I SAID SOMETHING WRONG, NOW I LONG FOR YESTERDAY

YESTERDAY, LOVE WAS SUCN AN EASY GAME TO PLAY
NOW I NEED A PLACE TO HIDE AWAY.
OH I BELIEVE IN YESTERDAY.
